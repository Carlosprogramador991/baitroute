## Usage
Once you have BaitRoute up and running, you can start creating your bait endpoints by defining route configurations in the provided JSON format. Customize these routes to closely resemble common vulnerabilities to attract potential attackers.

Here's a basic example of a route configuration:
```json
{
    "route": "/admin",
    "method": "POST",
    "response": {
        "status": 200,
        "body": {
            "message": "Invalid credentials"
        }
    }
}
```

## Examples
#### Example 1: Creating a Fake Login Endpoint
Suppose you want to create a fake login endpoint to lure in attackers. You can set up a route like this:
```json
{
    "route": "/login",
    "method": "POST",
    "response": {
        "status": 401,
        "body": {
            "message": "Incorrect username or password"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Example 2: Simulating SQL Injection Vulnerability
To mimic an SQL injection vulnerability, you can configure a route as follows:
```json
{
    "route": "/user",
    "method": "GET",
    "response": {
        "status": 500,
        "body": {
            "message": "Internal Server Error"
        }
    }
}
```
